# GNOMO
GNOMO is a Gencode for NOn Model Organism

GNOMO allow to count the number of CpG from WGBS-Seq data into the different genomic part, as in :

- Upstream and Downstream (2kb before/after the TSS - Transcription Start Site and TES - Transcription End Site).
2Kb is used here like in Wang et al. 2014 (doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-1119)<sup>1</sup>
